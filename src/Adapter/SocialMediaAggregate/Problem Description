Problem Statement - to create a Social media Aggregator.

Idea - To adopt to any social media post/comment .... api's we add adaptors in between our api's and specific social media api's.

About adaptors:

Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together.
The pattern involves creating an adapter class that bridges the gap between the interfaces, allowing them to communicate effectively.
